      Welcome to Revevo - a project that aims to bring the classic Vevo website back to life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original Vevo website shut down years ago, but their internal servers are still online (although not fully up
      to date). Using the still-active
      APIs
      from the Vevo TV
      app, Revevo reconstructs the old Vevo experience: music videos, curated playlists, and artist pages, all
      rebuilt for a desktop/mobile web experience.
